# Introduction

Evento Framework is a Java library designed to simplify the development of reactive systems based on the RECQ architecture. RECQ stands for:

* **Reactive:** Systems are responsive to user interactions and data changes.
* **Event-driven:** Communication between different parts of the application happens through events.
* **CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation):** Separate components handle data reads (queries) and writes (commands) for better performance and scalability.
* **Microservices:** The application is broken down into smaller, independent services that communicate with each other.

Evento Framework provides functionalities to implement these RECQ principles effectively. Here are some key features of Evento:

* **Event Handling:** Evento offers functionalities for publishing and subscribing to events, enabling communication between different parts of the application.
* **Reactive Components:** The framework helps build reactive components that respond asynchronously to events and data changes.
* **CQRS Support:** Evento streamlines the implementation of CQRS architecture by providing separate mechanisms for handling commands and queries.
* **Simplified Communication:** It facilitates communication between microservices using asynchronous messaging patterns.

**Benefits of using Evento Framework:**

* **Improved Maintainability:** By promoting modularity and clear separation of concerns, Evento makes applications easier to understand and maintain.
* **Scalability:** The microservices architecture supported by Evento allows for easier scaling of the application as needed.
* **Resilience:** Event-driven communication helps build more resilient applications as failures in one component are less likely to cascade to others.
* **Faster Development:** The framework provides reusable components and patterns, speeding up development compared to building everything from scratch.

**Who should use Evento Framework?**

Evento Framework is well-suited for developers who want to build:

* Reactive and scalable Java applications
* Applications leveraging the RECQ architecture
* Microservices-based systems with asynchronous communication
