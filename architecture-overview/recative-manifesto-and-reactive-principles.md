# Recative Manifesto & Reactive Principles

Modern applications face unprecedented demands: delivering seamless user experiences, handling high volumes of data, and adapting to ever-changing environments. Enter the world of **Reactive Systems**, a powerful approach championed by the **Reactive Manifesto** and the **Reactive Principles**.

[**The Reactive Manifesto**](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/)**: Building Resilient Systems for the Modern Age**

The Reactive Manifesto outlines four key principles for designing responsive, resilient, and elastic systems:

* **Responsive:** Systems should deliver timely feedback to users, ensuring a smooth and interactive experience.
* **Resilient:** They must be able to withstand failures and recover gracefully, minimizing downtime and data loss.
* **Elastic:** The ability to scale resources effortlessly, adapt to fluctuations in workloads is crucial.
* **Message-Driven:** Asynchronous message exchange promotes loose coupling and simplifies communication between components.

By adhering to these principles, developers can create applications that excel in:

* **High Concurrency:** Handling multiple requests simultaneously without performance degradation.
* **Dynamic Scalability:** Adapting to changing demands by adding or removing resources as needed.
* **Reliable User Experiences:** Delivering consistent and responsive experiences even under heavy load.

[**The Reactive Principles**](https://www.reactiveprinciples.org/)**: Putting Theory into Practice**

The Reactive Principles serve as a companion document to the Manifesto. It delves deeper, providing practical guidance and established techniques from experienced practitioners. These principles guide the development of individual services, applications, and entire systems aligned with the Reactive approach. It translates the high-level ideas of the Manifesto into actionable steps for software architects and developers, incorporating concepts from:

* **Reactive Programming:** A programming paradigm that embraces asynchronous data streams and event-driven models.
* **Reactive Systems:** The architectural style is built upon these programming principles for robust distributed applications.

**Evento Framework: Simplifying RECQ Architecture for Your Next Project**

The Evento Framework enters the scene by specifically targeting the implementation of **RECQ architectures**. RECQ stands for **Reactive Event-Driven CQRS** and is a specific type of Reactive architecture focused on building event-driven microservices. By leveraging the principles outlined in the Reactive Manifesto and the practical guidance of the Reactive Principles, Evento empowers developers to construct highly scalable and maintainable microservices within JavaEE environments.

In the following sections, we'll delve deeper into RECQ architectures, explore the specific features of the Evento Framework, and discover how it streamlines the development of robust and responsive applications for the modern world.
