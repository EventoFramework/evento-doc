# Recative Manifesto & Reactive Principles

[**The Reactive Manifesto** ](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/)outlines principles for building responsive, resilient, elastic, and message-driven systems. It emphasizes timely feedback, fault tolerance, dynamic scalability, and efficient communication. By following these principles, developers can create applications capable of **handling** high concurrency, adapting to changing conditions, and delivering reliable user experiences.

[**The Reactive Principles** ](https://www.reactiveprinciples.org/)is a document that provides guidance and techniques established among experienced Reactive practitioners for building individual services, applications, and whole systems. As a companion to the Reactive Manifesto it incorporates the ideas, paradigms, methods, and patterns from both Reactive Programming and Reactive Systems into a set of practical principles that software architects and developers can apply in their transformative work.
