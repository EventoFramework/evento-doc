# Distributed Systems & Microservices

**Distributed systems** are networks of interconnected computers that work together to achieve a common goal. They distribute tasks and data across multiple machines for improved performance, fault tolerance, and scalability. Distributed systems require careful coordination and communication to ensure consistency and synchronization of data. They provide a robust framework for efficient resource utilization and support the demands of modern computing environments.

[**Microservices** ](https://microservices.io/)architecture is an approach to building applications as a collection of **small**, **loosely coupled**, and **independently deployable services**. Each service in a microservices architecture focuses on a **specific business capability**, and they **communicate with each other** through well-defined APIs.
