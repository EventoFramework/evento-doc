# State-of-the-art Patterns

[**DDD (Domain Driven Design)**   ](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Domain-driven\_design) is a design approach based on the domain model to analyze, design and implement systems for scalability and maintainability.

[**CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Separation)**   ](https://cqrs.files.wordpress.com/2010/11/cqrs\_documents.pdf) is a design pattern that separates the read and write operations of an application, optimizing performance, scalability, and flexibility.

[**Event Sourcing** ](https://martinfowler.com/eaaDev/EventSourcing.html)is a pattern where the state of an application is derived by replaying events. Events are stored as a log, enabling auditability, temporal queries, and reconstructing state at any point in time.

[**Messaging** ](https://microservices.io/patterns/communication-style/messaging.html)pattern involves communication between microservices through asynchronous message passing using message queues or event-driven systems, promoting loose coupling, scalability, and fault tolerance in distributed systems.

[**Saga** ](https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html)is a design pattern for handling long-lived transactions in distributed systems. It ensures eventual consistency by coordinating a sequence of local transactional steps across multiple services.
