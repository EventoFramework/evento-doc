# Component to System State Store

Communication from a [component ](../recq-system-pattern/component.md)to the [System State Store (SSS) ](../recq-system-pattern/system-state-store.md)can only be a request for posting a state change event, in which case the request will leverage a synchronous protocol managed by the SSS itself.
