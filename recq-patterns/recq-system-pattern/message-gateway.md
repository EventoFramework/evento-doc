# Message Gateway

Components cannot directly interact with each other with direct invocations. A component only knows possible messages and responses from the entire system. It then sends messages through the Message Gateway and waits for replies.

The message gateway implements the [Publish/Async Response pattern via â€œcorrelation id"](https://microservices.io/patterns/communication-style/messaging.html). This module has two sub-modules, the Command Gateway and the Query Gateway.

### **Command Gateway**&#x20;

This module is used to be able to make command-type requests. It exposes a single type of asynchronous method called "send" which takes a message of type Command as input and, in the event of an action that has taken place, returns the event generated by the component that handled the request, otherwise a failure error.

### **Query Gateway**

This module is used to make query-type requests. It exposes only one type of asynchronous method called "query" which takes as input a message of type Query and returns an object of type `QueryResponse` containing the requested data.
