# Introduction

Evento Framework is an Ecosystem of software built to implement JavaEE [Reactive Systems](https://www.reactivemanifesto.org/en) applying [RECQ Patterns](broken-reference), allowing you to build Enterprise applications clearly and efficiently following the state-of-the-art for distributed systems.

With this framework, you can implement Responsive, Resilient, Elastic, Maintainable, Extensible and Observable Microservices Architectures by applying concepts like CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Separation), Evento Sourcing and DDD (Domain Driven Design)
